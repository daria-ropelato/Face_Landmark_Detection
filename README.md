# âœ¨ Real-Time Face Landmark Detection

This project demonstrates real-time facial landmark detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe's Face Mesh. The application detects and tracks facial landmarks from a webcam feed, drawing points on key facial features.

## Features
- Detects and tracks **468 facial landmarks** in real-time.
- Uses **MediaPipe Face Mesh** for robust face tracking.
- Visualizes landmarks on the webcam feed with OpenCV.

## Potential Applications
- **Augmented Reality (AR):** Use the detected landmarks to overlay virtual objects like glasses, hats, or makeup.
- **Educational Tool:** Learn how face tracking works and visualize facial landmarks.
- **Interactive Applications:** Build games or emotion-detection systems.

## Technologies Used
- **OpenCV**: For video capture and display.
- **MediaPipe**: For high-performance face tracking.
- **Python 3**

## How It Works
1. **Capture Webcam Feed**: Use OpenCV to capture a live feed from the webcam.
2. **Process Frames**: Convert the frames to RGB and process them with MediaPipe Face Mesh.
3. **Draw Landmarks**: Overlay circles on detected facial landmarks.
4. **Real-Time Interaction**: Display the processed frames in real-time.
